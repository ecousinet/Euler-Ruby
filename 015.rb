# Problem 15
#
# Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to
# the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
#
# How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

# Comment :
# I initially thought about making a naive program that would explore all
# the possibitliy iteratively but I felt that this problem could be strictly
# answered by mathematics so I choose this option
